music player app that backs up to drive
major concept is the backup
so start is the music player app with good look and feel (consider pulsar +)
next step is the back up to a specific thrid party drive (e.g. mega) so allow for extension to drive on look of app
music app plays music offline. back up needs internet but should not interfere with oofline music flow in any way
so backing up music is in the background 
backs up over internet and pauses backup on internet disruption (notification or not??)
((check out how deezer does it.)) 
limited backup (do i neeed to inform people??)
user has to create account for backing up that has limited phone access but should get complete access from PC
limited phone access meaning (with internet access) user has to log in then music gets backed up in the background 
complete access on PC meaning user sees complete list of backed up music on drive (MUST have internet access)
